# FF14_Blacklist

A simple Blacklist Tool for FF14 Chinese players, especially for the players who log in Baidu Tieba usually.
For some reasons, the original FF14 blacklist system within the game client is not that useful for many users. Neither can it mark the players not in the same server, nor can it comment the blacklist reasons.
So I made a small software, a .NET winform software, no need other using environment, just the same as FF14 itself.

Please feel free to contact when you meet any problem while using.
